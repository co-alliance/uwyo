# Islandora Newspaper Batch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/discoverygarden/islandora_newspaper_batch.png?branch=7.x)](https://travis-ci.org/discoverygarden/islandora_newspaper_batch)

## Introduction

This module extends the Islandora batch framework so as to provide a Drush and
GUI option to add newspaper issues and pages to an existing newspaper object.

The ingest is a two-step process:

* Preprocessing: The data is scanned and a number of entries are created in the
  Drupal database.  There is minimal processing done at this point, so preprocessing can
  be completed outside of a batch process.
* Ingest: The data is actually processed and ingested. This happens inside of
  a Drupal batch.

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Islandora](https://github.com/islandora/islandora)
* [Tuque](https://github.com/islandora/tuque)


# Installation

Install as usual, see [this](https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7) for further information.

## Configuration

N/A

### Usage

The base ZIP/directory preprocessor can be called as a drush script (see `drush help islandora_newspaper_batch_preprocess` for additional parameters):

`drush -v --user=admin --uri=http://localhost islandora_newspaper_batch_preprocess --type=zip --target=/path/to/archive.zip --parent=namespace:some_newspaper`

This will populate the queue (stored in the Drupal database) with base entries.

Newspaper must be broken up into separate directories, such that each directory at the "top" level (in the target directory or Zip file) represents a newspaper issue. Newspaper pages are their own directories inside of each newsppaper issue directory.

Files are assigned to object datastreams based on their basename, so a folder structure like:

* my_cool_newspaper/
    * MODS.xml
    * 1/
        * OBJ.tiff
    * 2/
        * OBJ.tiff

would result in a two-page newspaper issue. Other files, with base names corresponding to datastream IDs, can be included in each page subfolder, such as JP2.jp2, OCR.txt, and TN.jpg. If files like these are included, they will be used as the content of their respective datastreams, and the batch process will not recreate the datastreams.

A file named --METADATA--.xml can contain either MODS, DC or MARCXML which is used to fill in the MODS or DC streams (if not provided explicitly). Similarly, --METADATA--.mrc (containing binary MARC) will be transformed to MODS and then possibly to DC, if neither are provided explicitly.

If no MODS is provided at the newspaper issue level - either directly as MODS.xml, or transformed from either a DC.xml or the "--METADATA--" file discussed above - the directory name will be used as the title.

The queue of preprocessed items can then be processed:

`drush -v --user=admin --uri=http://localhost islandora_batch_ingest`

### Sample Issue-level MODS.xml file
Here is a sample MODS file describing a newspaper issue. Note that it does not contain a `<relatedItem>` element as a direct child of `<mods>`:

```xml

### Customization

Custom ingests can be written by [extending](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_batch/wiki/How-To-Extend) any of the existing preprocessors and batch object implementations.
